## Interactions ##

The key interactions for the Clinical Decision Support API are represented in the diagrams below.

### Invoke ServiceDefinition.$evaluate and GuidanceResponse ###

The triage journey starts with the user requesting decision support from CDSS.

The core of the triage journey is invoking the `ServiceDefinition` via the $evaluate operation by the EMS. This in turn has a response from the CDSS of a `GuidanceResponse` resource and is the primary message generated by the CDSS.

This interaction is expected to be repeated multiple times during the triage journey as the EMS presents responses to CDSS questions until an end result is reached. 

The `GuidanceResponse` includes all information relating to the CDSS response.

View the [Evaluate ServiceDefinition](/api_post_service_definition.html) and [GuidanceResponse](/api_guidance_response.html) sections for detailed guidance.


### Questionnaire interaction ###

The CDSS determines the next question to ask and returns a `GuidanceResponse` containing the `Questionnaire` reference.

The EMS presents the question to the user and the user responds via the EMS.

The User response is included within the next `ServiceDefinition`.$evaluate operation to the CDSS.

This interaction is expected to be repeated multiple times during the triage journey as different questions are presented to the user from the CDSS.

View the [Get Questionnaire](/api_get_questionnaire.html) section for more information.


### CDSS assertion ###
The CDSS evaluates the observation submitted by the user and uses this to create an assertion.

The CDSS determines whether there is enough information to arrive at a result. If not, another question is returned to be answered.
 
The `GuidanceResponse` returned to the EMS now has the asserted observation and the next question for the EMS to display.

### Arriving at a result ###
The EMS invokes a `ServiceDefinition`.$evaluate operation containing the `questionnaire` response and any previous assertions for the CDSS to evaluate.

The CDSS creates another assertion from the questionnaire response and determines a result can be provided. 

The result is sent to the EMS within the `GuidanceResponse` and the EMS displays the result to the User.
